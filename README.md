# addz

This program takes a text file formatted like the two included (bands1Col.txt | bands5Col.txt)

It produces the total count represented by the amount in the **416 groups**
where each **group** has a Number of Essentially Different grid count on that group
each group is an equivalence class of the symmetries (rows 1,2,3) of the usual 9x9 Sudoku grids

(Number of essentially different minlex grids in each group)[https://github.com/1to9only/essentially-different-minlex-grids]
